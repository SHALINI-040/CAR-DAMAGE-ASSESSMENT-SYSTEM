# CAR-DAMAGE-ASSESSMENT-SYSTEM
Uses YOLOv8 deep learning model, trained with data from Roboflow, to automatically detect make and model of the car, classify the parts, and assess the severity of the damaged car using Trained model and Python code. Our system eliminates the need for manual inspections in the automobile industry, streamlining the insurance claim process.
A new framework for car damage assessment has been developed to automate the insurance claim process using deep learning. This system uses two important datasets. The first is the Car Make and Model (CMM) dataset, which includes images of 23 car makes and 148 models commonly found in the Indian market. The second is a larger dataset with 222,000 images annotated with different types of car damage. These images, collected from insurance offices and online sources, are labeled based on damage type (like dents, scratches, and cracks), severity, and location (front, back, or side).
This system combines visual data with structured information to accurately estimate repair costs. This reduces the time required for manual assessments and simplifies the claim process. The framework uses the advanced CDA_YOLOv8 model, which achieves a per-class accuracy of 87.36% and an overall accuracy of 90.45%. This performance surpasses existing models, providing an efficient and reliable solution for insurers and customers alike.
